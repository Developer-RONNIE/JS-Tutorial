#### What determines there difference ? 
1. Call by Value : 
the original reference of the memory is not shared,
the changes made in these are changed in the copy of them.

In call by value method of parameter passing, the values of actual parameters are copied to the functionâ€™s formal parameters.

-> There are two copies of parameters stored in different memory locations.
-> One is the original copy and the other is the function copy.
-> Any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.


2. Call by Reference :

In call by reference method of parameter passing, the address of the actual parameters is passed to the function as the formal parameters.

-> Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations.
-> Any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.


depending on how the data is stored in memory 
and 
and how can you access or retrieve your stored data 





#### Is JavaScript a statically or a dynamically typed language?

-> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, but TypeScript is a statically typed language.

In dynamically typed languages all type checks are performed in a runtime,
only when your program is executing. 
So this means you can just assign anything you want to the variable and it will work.

let a
a = 0
console.log(a) // 0
a = 'Hello world'
console.log(a) // Hello world
a = { 'key': 'value' }
console.log(a) // {key:'value'}

If we take a look at Typescript, it is a statically typed language,
so all checks will be performed during compile/build run before we actually execute our program.

So the previous code with added variable a type won't work. 
Even from the JavaScript standpoint it is valid (except types) and will run without any errors.
