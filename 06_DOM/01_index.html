        <p>
            DOM stands for Document Object Model </br>
            At the end of the day whatever we use, react / angular. They are all made of some object. </br>
            Similar to this html file. This is also a document. </br>
            What are objects in this file ? </br>
            head, body, paragrapgh all of these are objects </br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand better </br>
            Step1: Open any wikipedia page. I will recommend to search about "Brendan Eich". One of the founder of JS.</br>
            Step2: Inspect on the page and try console.log(window)</br>
            you can notice further functions within it. But we need to focus on the document property</br>
            We will see further details about the document like - jquery, location, baseURI etc. </br>
            Step3: console.log(document) or console.log(windows.document)</br>
            Here we won't see all those additional things popping out. </br>
            We will simply get the head & body </br>
            Conclusion: Incase we need to access everything about the document & perform complex task </br>
            We can simply check console.dir(doument) </br>
            For getting full details about the document 
        </p>
        <!-- Let's try creating the diagram of DOM of this particular file  -->
        <p>
            Why pracricing the diagram of document is necessary ? </br>
            To understand the relationship(parent-child class) between objects / figure out siblings </br>
            Here, below diagram represents the DOM representation of this particular page. </br>
            ZOOM IN for better Look </br>

        <h1 class="heading">DOM Manipulation </h1>
        <p>
            Step1: Open any wikipedia page. I will recommend to search about "Brendan Eich". One of the founder of JS.</br>
            Step2: Inspect on the page and try "document.getElementById('firstHeading')" </br>
            You will get the desired element & it's further details ( you can select any another element too)</br>
            Step3: document.getElementById('firstHeading').innerHTML ="<h1>Code with Ronnie</h1>" 
            </br>
            here we used ".innerHTML" to replace the HTNL used inside the web page </br>
            This is all about DOM Manipulation. We will learn more about it in the next section.
